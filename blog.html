   <h3> # LocalStorage Sessionstorage</h3>

    <P class="one">01.That is, the data stored in localStorage persists until explicitly deleted. Changes made are saved and available for all current and future visits to the site. 
       </p> 
    <p> 02.For sessionStorage, changes are only available per tab. Changes made are saved and available for the current page in that tab until it is closed. Once it is closed, the stored data is deleted.
     </P>
   <h3> # Global & Block scope</h3>

     <p>01.In javascript the whole document is global scope and all the other functions and variables are contained in this global scope.</p>

    <P>
     02. A variable when declared inside the if or switch conditions or inside for or while loops, are accessible within that particular condition or loop. To be consise the variables declared inside the curly braces are called as within block scope.
     let & const are also called as block scope.
     </P>
   <h3># Event Loop</h3>
     <p>
        The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.
